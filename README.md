# What is This Project?  
Idle-Matic is my pet project that is meant to solve the ultimate problem of Idle games, read more [here](https://github.com/Zebralear/Idle-Matic/wiki).  
  
I now have a collection of Trellos for IM! [link](https://trello.com/b/OQwwDAFl/idle-matic-development-full-plan)  
  
Development on this project **will** be slow, as it is secondary to my grades at school (not by my own choice either).
