# What is This Project?  
Idle-Matic is my pet project that is meant to solve the ultimate problem of Idle games, read more [here](https://github.com/Zebralear/Idle-Matic/wiki).
  
Development on this project **will** be slow, as it is secondary to my grades at school (not by my own choice either).

## Update
I am excited to announce that, as of December 9th, 2018 the development of Idle-Matic will be postponed for the forseeable future. Time I would've wasted making IM will now go towards a new 'game': Project **P.A.R.Z.I.V.A.L**  
The nature of **PARZIVAL** is highly secretive, so it will not be open source; I am certain, however, that some of the people on the internet will be able to decipher the purpose of **PARZIVAL** long before it is released.

GOOD LUCK ON YOUR HUNT!
